# tfslurm
Boilerplate and utility code for using distributed Tensorflow with SLURM

SLURM environment parsing is lifted from: https://github.com/deepsense-ai/tensorflow_on_slurm



## TODOS:
- Make compatible with heterogeneous job, which is available for newer versions of SLURM
- Make sure that local dummy object works seemlessly
- Write unit tests
- Run benchmarks on cluster
